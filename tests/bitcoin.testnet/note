TODO: 

Because `tests` is the `DirExcavator` directory of `BpDirMound`, 
Rgb will search for `schemata` and `contracts` in this directory.

When detecting `contracts`, it will search in `tests/bitcoin.testnet`,

If this directory does not exist, it will report an error, 
So you need to create this directory in advance.

The corresponding code is `rgb-std/src/mound.rs#L311`
